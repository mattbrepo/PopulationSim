# PopulationSim
A simulation on a population using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/).

**Language: Python**

**Start: 2023**

## Why
I wanted to try [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) to simulate a population behavior.

## The simulation
The individuals of the population are represented as circles of different sizes and colors:

Coral-like colors are for females and bluish colors for male. There are two sizes: small for young and big for adult individuals.

## GUI
I also developed a simple GUI with [CustomTinker](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/wiki) which can be used to start the simulation and to change the parameters also while the simulation is running:
